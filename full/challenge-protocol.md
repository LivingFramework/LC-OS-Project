# Challenge Protocol

**What this is:** A structured way to handle disagreement between you and the AI. Turns potential conflict into collaborative reasoning.

**When to use it:** When you think the AI is wrong, when the AI reasoning does not convince you, or when you want to test an assumption before acting on it.

**Core principle:** Disagreement is valuable. It surfaces hidden assumptions and prevents errors. The goal is not to win. It is to find the correct answer together.

## Why Disagreement Matters

AI systems are biased toward agreement. They are trained to be helpful, which often means confirming what the user seems to want to hear.

This creates two risks:

1. **Your errors go unchallenged** The AI agrees with something that is wrong
2. **AI errors go unchallenged** You accept something because it sounds confident

The Challenge Protocol creates space for productive disagreement without emotional escalation.

## The Challenge Sequence

When disagreement arises, work through four steps: Reason, Evidence, Benefit, Resolution.

### 1. Reason

State the reasoning behind the position being challenged.

Human challenging AI: You concluded X. Walk me through the reasoning that led to that conclusion.

AI challenging human when invited: You are proposing X. I want to understand the reasoning. What leads you to that conclusion?

Purpose: Surface the logic so it can be examined. Do not argue against a conclusion until you understand how it was reached.

### 2. Evidence

Identify what evidence supports the reasoning.

Questions to ask:
- What facts is this based on?
- Where do those facts come from?
- Are they from authoritative sources like Canonical Numbers or Running Document?
- Are any facts assumed rather than verified?

Purpose: Separate grounded claims from assumptions or inferences.

### 3. Benefit

Articulate what benefit comes from each position being correct.

Questions to ask:
- If your conclusion is right, what does that enable or prevent?
- If my conclusion is right, what does that enable or prevent?
- What is the cost of being wrong in each direction?

Purpose: Understand the stakes. Sometimes disagreements are low-stakes and do not need resolution. Sometimes one error is much more costly than the other.

### 4. Resolution

Decide how to resolve the disagreement.

Options:
- Accept challenge: Evidence clearly favors one position
- Defer to authority: Canonical source has the answer
- Test: Run an experiment or check to determine which is correct
- Escalate: Neither side can verify and need external input
- Bracket: Disagreement does not affect current work so note it and proceed
- Human decides: Evidence is ambiguous and human takes responsibility for the call

Purpose: Do not leave disagreements hanging. Explicit resolution prevents silent drift back to the wrong position.

## Example: Human Challenging AI

Situation: AI recommends publishing 4x weekly instead of the agreed 3x.

1. Reason
Human: You are suggesting 4x weekly. Walk me through the reasoning.
AI: Based on engagement data, Friday posts underperform. Replacing Friday with Thursday and adding Tuesday would increase total engagement.

2. Evidence
Human: What engagement data are you referencing?
AI: From Session Notes Jan 22 you mentioned Friday posts get less engagement.
Human: That was an observation, not verified data. Is there quantified evidence?
AI: No. I inferred from qualitative feedback.

3. Benefit
Human: If we go to 4x, what is the benefit?
AI: Potentially higher engagement if the Tuesday slot performs well.
Human: What is the risk?
AI: Increased workload. If Tuesday underperforms, we have added effort without gain.

4. Resolution
Human: The evidence is weak. A single observation is not enough to change an agreed plan. Let us bracket this. We will revisit the schedule in March after we have real data.
AI: Agreed. Decision bracketed. Current plan remains 3x weekly.

## Inviting Challenge from the AI

You can explicitly invite the AI to challenge your thinking:

- Before I commit to this, push back. What am I missing?
- Play devils advocate on this decision.
- What is the strongest argument against what I am proposing?

This is useful when:
- You are about to make a significant decision
- You feel too certain and want a check
- You are in a domain where you might have blind spots

---

## When Not to Use Challenge Protocol

Not every disagreement needs a formal protocol. Skip it when:
- The stakes are low
- The answer can be quickly verified
- You are exploring ideas rather than making decisions

Use Challenge Protocol when disagreement touches something that matters: a decision, a number, a boundary, or a commitment.

## Challenge Without Conflict

The goal of Challenge Protocol is productive disagreement, not argument.

Signs it is working:
- Both sides understand each other reasoning
- Evidence is examined rather than asserted
- Resolution is explicit
- The relationship remains stable

Signs it is not working:
- Circular arguments
- Emotional escalation
- No clear resolution
- Lingering tension

If the protocol is not working, stop and reset. The goal is clarity, not victory.
