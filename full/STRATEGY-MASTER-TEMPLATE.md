# Strategy Master Template

**Purpose:** Long-term strategic truth — principles, policies, boundaries, and logic that remain stable across sessions.

**Location:** This is one of your three authoritative files. The others are Canonical Numbers (numeric truth) and Running Document (session-level decisions).

**Update frequency:** Rarely. Only when strategy fundamentally changes. Most day-to-day updates go in the Running Document.

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Define once, reference often** — Write your strategic logic here, then point to it rather than re-explaining
2. **Keep it stable** — This is not a working document. Changes require explicit decision and versioning
3. **Separate from numbers** — No live data here. Numbers live in Canonical Numbers Sheet
4. **AI reads this** — Share at session start when strategic context matters

## 1. Strategic Scope

*What domains/areas does this strategy cover?*

**In scope:**
- [Domain 1]
- [Domain 2]
- [Domain 3]

**Out of scope:**
- [What this strategy does NOT cover]

---

## 2. Core Principles

*Non-negotiable principles that guide all decisions in this domain.*

### Principle 1: [Name]
[Description — what it means and why it matters]

### Principle 2: [Name]
[Description]

### Principle 3: [Name]
[Description]

---

## 3. Strategic Boundaries

*Hard limits that cannot be crossed without explicit review.*

| Boundary | Limit | Consequence if Crossed |
|----------|-------|------------------------|
| [e.g., Risk tolerance] | [e.g., Never exceed X%] | [e.g., Immediate stop and review] |
| [Boundary 2] | [Limit] | [Consequence] |
| [Boundary 3] | [Limit] | [Consequence] |

---

## 4. Decision Logic

*How decisions are made within this strategy.*

### 4.1 Decision Authority

| Decision Type | Who Decides | AI Role |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| [e.g., Major strategic change] | Human only | Advise, do not recommend |
| [e.g., Execution within strategy] | Human with AI input | Can recommend |
| [e.g., Routine implementation] | AI can draft | Human approves |

### 4.2 Decision Criteria

*When facing a choice in this domain, evaluate against:*

1. [Criterion 1 — e.g., Does it align with Principle 1?]
2. [Criterion 2 — e.g., Does it stay within boundaries?]
3. [Criterion 3 — e.g., Is it reversible if wrong?]

---

## 5. Policies

*Standing rules that apply unless explicitly overridden.*

### Policy 1: [Name]
- **Rule:** [What to do]
- **Applies when:** [Conditions]
- **Exceptions:** [If any]

### Policy 2: [Name]
- **Rule:** [What to do]
- **Applies when:** [Conditions]
- **Exceptions:** [If any]

---

## 6. Pillar Separation (if applicable)

*If your work spans multiple domains (pillars), define separation here.*

| Pillar | Scope | Governed By |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [e.g., Finance] | [What it covers] | [This Strategy Master / separate one] |
| [e.g., Research] | [What it covers] | [Reference] |
| [e.g., Personal] | [What it covers] | [Reference] |

**Cross-pillar rules:**
- [e.g., Finance decisions do not influence Research priorities]
- [e.g., When pillars conflict, escalate to explicit human decision]

---

## 7. Review Cadence

*When and how this document is reviewed.*

| Review Type | Frequency | Focus |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Light check | Monthly | Still accurate? Any drift? |
| Full review | Quarterly | Principles still valid? Boundaries correct? |
| Major revision | As needed | Triggered by significant life/strategy change |

**Next scheduled review:** [DATE]

## 8. Relationship to Other Authoritative Files

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Strategy Master** → stable, rarely changes
- **Canonical Numbers** → updated when data changes, never invented
- **Running Document** → updated every session, captures active state

## Template Notes

**For simple collaborations:** You may not need a separate Strategy Master. The Running Document can carry strategic context if your domain is straightforward.

**For complex collaborations:** Use this template when you have:
- Multiple domains (pillars) requiring separation
- Long-term strategic logic that shouldn't be re-debated
- Hard boundaries that must be enforced
- Policies that apply across many sessions

**First-time setup:**
1. Fill Sections 1-5 at minimum
2. Section 6 only if you have multiple pillars
3. Set your review cadence (Section 7)
4. Share with AI at start of strategy-relevant sessions
