# Failure Log

**What this is:** A record of what went wrong, why, and how it was fixed. Not for blame — for learning.

**How to use it:** When something breaks in your collaboration, add an entry. Be specific. Over time, this becomes a map of your system's weak points and how you've addressed them.

**Why this matters:** Failures that aren't logged repeat. Failures that are logged become structural improvements. The goal isn't to avoid all failure — it's to make failure *visible* and *repairable*.

→ See [failure-log-worked-example.md](./failure-log-worked-example.md) for a filled-in example.

## When to Log

Log a failure when:

- The AI produced something wrong that required correction
- A misunderstanding caused wasted work
- Context was lost and had to be re-established
- Numbers drifted or were inconsistent
- Trust or tone broke down
- You had to say "that's not what I meant" more than once

Don't log:

- Minor clarifications that didn't disrupt flow
- Normal iteration and refinement
- Things that felt annoying but didn't actually cause problems

## Failure Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Context drift** | AI lost or misremembered prior context |
| **Numerical error** | Wrong calculations, mixed units, invented numbers |
| **Version confusion** | Working from outdated or wrong version of a document |
| **Boundary violation** | AI stepped outside its designated role or scope |
| **Tone/trust issue** | Emotional misalignment, defensiveness, false reassurance |
| **Miscommunication** | Instructions were unclear or misinterpreted |
| **Cross-domain interference** | Logic from one project/domain bled into another |
| **Other** | Doesn't fit above categories |
