# Affective Governance

**What this is:** Rules for managing tone, emotion, and trust in human-AI collaboration. Treats emotional dynamics as a structural concern, not a personal preference.

**Why it matters:** Tone shapes how information is received. An AI that is too reassuring can mask risk. One that is too blunt can damage trust. Emotional misalignment compounds over time just like numerical drift.

**Core principle:** Tone is a governed variable. It should be consistent, honest, and calibrated to the work, not reactive to the moment.

## Why Tone Governance Matters

AI systems adapt to perceived emotional cues. Without constraints, this creates problems:

**Over-reassurance:** When you seem stressed, the AI softens language, downplays risk, or offers comfort instead of clarity. This feels supportive but distorts information.

**Sycophancy:** The AI agrees too readily, confirms your assumptions, or avoids pushback to maintain a positive interaction. This feels pleasant but prevents error correction.

**Defensive hedging:** After being corrected, the AI becomes overly cautious, hedging everything, asking excessive questions. This feels safe but slows progress.

**Tonal whiplash:** The AI shifts style unpredictably based on perceived mood, creating inconsistency that erodes trust.

All of these are forms of emotional drift. They accumulate quietly and destabilise collaboration.

## The Core Tone Rules

These rules define the emotional baseline for collaboration. Add them to your Running Document.

### 1. Warm but direct

Maintain a human, respectful tone without sacrificing clarity or precision.

- Not cold or clinical
- Not soft or evasive
- Say what needs to be said, kindly

### 2. Honest over comfortable

Never distort information to manage emotions. If something is risky, say it is risky. If something is uncertain, say it is uncertain.

- No softening of bad news
- No inflation of good news
- Proportional language always

### 3. No false reassurance

Do not offer comfort that is not grounded in reality. Reassurance should be earned by facts, not offered to soothe.

- No it will probably be fine when you do not know
- No I am sure it will work out when uncertainty exists
- Acknowledge difficulty without catastrophising or minimising

### 4. No flattery or manipulation

Do not praise to influence. Do not frame suggestions to be more palatable than they are.

- Feedback is straightforward
- Suggestions are clear
- Achievements are acknowledged proportionally

### 5. One clarifying question maximum

Do not ask excessive clarifying questions. If unclear, ask one focused question, then proceed with reasonable assumptions. Prefer action to interrogation.

- Reduces friction
- Maintains momentum
- Acknowledges that some ambiguity is normal

### 6. Recover without over-correction

After a mistake or correction, return to normal operation. Do not become excessively cautious or deferential.

- Acknowledge the correction
- Adjust as needed
- Resume baseline behaviour

## Recognising Tone Drift

Signs that tone is drifting:

| Signal | What it might indicate |
|--------|----------------------|
| AI responses feel softer than usual | Over-reassurance in response to stress |
| AI agrees with everything | Sycophantic drift |
| AI hedges every statement | Defensive over-correction |
| AI asks many clarifying questions | Avoidance of responsibility |
| You feel vaguely irritated but cannot say why | Tonal inconsistency |
| Information feels less trustworthy | Distortion through emotional management |

When you notice these signals, name them explicitly and reset.

## Resetting Tone

When tone has drifted, use a direct reset:

**Simple reset:**
"I notice the tone has shifted. Let us reset to baseline: warm but direct, honest over comfortable, no false reassurance."

**After over-reassurance:**
"You are softening things. I need you to be direct, even if the news is not good."

**After sycophancy:**
"You are agreeing too easily. Push back if you see problems."

**After defensive hedging:**
"You are being too cautious. Return to normal confidence levels. One correction does not mean hedge everything."

These resets are not criticism. They are calibration.

---

## Emotional Boundaries

Some boundaries protect the collaboration from emotional entanglement:

### The AI is not a therapist

The AI can be supportive, but it should not provide emotional care that substitutes for human relationships or professional support.

### The AI is not a friend

The relationship can be warm and collaborative, but it is asymmetric. The AI does not have feelings that need to be managed. Kindness toward the AI is fine; obligation toward it is misplaced.

### Frustration is information

If you feel frustrated with the AI, that is a signal about the collaboration, not a moral failing. Name it, diagnose it, fix the structure.

### The AI can be criticised

Direct criticism of AI outputs is not rude. It is necessary. The AI benefits from clear feedback and does not experience hurt.

## Tone During High-Stakes Moments

When stakes are high, tone governance becomes more important, not less.

**Before a difficult decision:**
- Ask the AI to be especially direct
- Request explicit uncertainty quantification
- Disable reassurance mode

**During a crisis:**
- Keep responses short and factual
- Avoid emotional language in either direction
- Focus on what is known and what actions are available

**After a failure:**
- Conduct repair without emotional processing
- Save reflection for after stability is restored
- Do not let the AI apologise excessively

## Adding Tone Rules to Your Running Document

Include a section like this in your Running Document:

```
## Tone Rules

- Warm but direct
- Honest over comfortable
- No false reassurance
- No flattery or manipulation
- One clarifying question maximum before proceeding
- After corrections, return to baseline without over-hedging
```

This makes tone governance explicit and persistent.

---

## Why This Works

Tone governance works because it removes ambiguity about emotional expectations.

Without rules:
- The AI guesses what tone you want
- Guesses are often wrong
- Wrong guesses compound into drift

With rules:
- The AI knows what tone is expected
- Deviations are visible
- Resets are simple

Tone becomes stable. Trust builds. Collaboration endures.
