# Minimal LC-OS

**Four templates. Thirty minutes. See if it works for you.**

---

## What's Here

The minimal tier gives you the core of LC-OS without the full system. It's enough to:

- Stop context from evaporating between sessions
- Keep numbers consistent and traceable
- Start logging failures instead of hiding them

If this helps, you can expand to the Full-LC-OS later. If it doesn't fit your workflow, you've lost half an hour, not a week.

## The Four Templates

### 1. Running Document

This is your shared memory with the AI.

At the start of every session, you share this document. It contains: what you're working on, what's been decided, what rules apply, and any corrections made along the way.

The AI reads it. You're both aligned. Context persists.

---

### 2. Canonical Numbers

One file for all numerical data that matters.

The AI doesn't recalculate from memory. It looks here. If a number isn't in this file, it's not authoritative.

This eliminates the most common source of drift in quantitative work.

---

### 3. Failure Log

When something goes wrong, you log it.

Not for blame. For learning. Each entry captures: what broke, why, how it was fixed, and what changed to prevent recurrence.

Over time, this becomes a map of your collaboration's weak points — and how you've strengthened them.

---

### 4. Strategy Master

This is where the textual truth lives.

Project intent, rules, constraints, and decision rights.

This should NOT contain live numbers. Numbers belong in the Canonical.

---

## How to Use This

### First Session

1. Copy the four templates to wherever you keep project files
2. Fill in the Running Document with your current project context
3. Add any existing numbers to the Canonical Numbers file
4. Share the Running Document with your AI at the start of the session
5. Tell the AI: *"This is our Running Document. Read it at the start of each session. Reference it for decisions and context."*

### Every Session After

1. Share the Running Document at the start
2. Work normally
3. When decisions are made, update the Running Document
4. When numbers are confirmed, add them to Canonical Numbers
5. When something breaks, log it in the Failure Log
6. When any rules, narratives change update the Strategy Master
   

### When Things Break

Don't push through. Use the simple repair sequence:

1. **Stop** — pause the current task
2. **Diagnose** — what went wrong and why?
3. **Rollback** — return to the last stable state
4. **Note** — log the failure and update the Running Document

---

## What You'll Notice

After a few sessions:

- Less re-explaining of context
- Numbers stay consistent
- When errors happen, you have a record of how you fixed them
- The collaboration feels more stable

These are small wins, but they compound.

## When to Upgrade to Full-LC-OS

Consider moving to the Full if:

- You're working across multiple domains (e.g., finance + research + planning)
- Emotional tone and trust are becoming factors
- You want structured challenge and disagreement protocols
- Failures are frequent enough that you need a taxonomy

The minimal tier is enough for many projects. Don't upgrade out of enthusiasm — upgrade when you feel the limits.

---

## Questions?

If you adopt this and something isn't clear, the templates themselves have guidance. If you want the theory behind the practice, see the [research papers](https://github.com/LivingFramework/LC-OS) — but they're not required.

*Start simple. Add structure only when you need it.*
