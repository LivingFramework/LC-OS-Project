# Versioning & Change Control

## Rules
- Frozen vs Live: maintain a frozen ‘Canonical’ set; changes happen only in Live drafts.
- Release notes: every change gets a one‑line reason + impact.
- Small deltas: one change per release unless urgent bugfix.
- Rollback: if a change increases confusion, revert to last stable file immediately.
- Naming: vX.Y and date stamps; never overwrite frozen files.

## Minimal changelog format

CHANGELOG
