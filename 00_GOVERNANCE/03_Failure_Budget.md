# Failure Budget

Failure Budget (Starter)
- Expect: minor drift / misread 1–3 times per week in active projects.
- Expect: one ‘communication mismatch’ episode per month when tired or rushed.
- Rule: any detected drift triggers Repair Ticket (5–10 minutes) before continuing.
- If 2 repair tickets in one session: stop work, switch to cooldown, resume later.


## Repair Ticket (mini)

REPAIR TICKET
- Symptom: (what broke)
- Trigger: (what caused it)
- Root cause: (why it happened)
- Fix: (what we changed)
- Prevention: (one rule / change to reduce recurrence)
- Status: closed / open
