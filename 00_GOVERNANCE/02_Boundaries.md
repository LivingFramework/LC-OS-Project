# LC-OS Boundaries

## Who LC-OS is for
- People doing multi‑session work where consistency matters (writing, research, operations, investing execution discipline, projects).
- Users willing to maintain a small set of canonical files and follow lightweight process.
- Teams who want auditability (logs, versioning, repeatability) more than “creative vibe” output.

## Who LC-OS is not for
- One‑off casual Q&A where drift doesn’t matter.
- Users who want the model to ‘just remember everything’ without any external state.
- High‑stakes professional use without human verification (medical/legal/financial decisions must be independently verified).
- People who dislike any structure or logging.
